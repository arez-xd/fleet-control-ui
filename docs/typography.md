# Typography

The typography system is based on a fixed scale:

12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30

The scale is designed to support dense layouts and clear hierarchy without relying on excessive font weights or decorative sizes.

## Semantic roles

Typography is consumed via roles, not numeric values:

- `type.ui.h1` — page titles
- `type.ui.h2` — section headers
- `type.ui.h3` — card titles
- `type.ui.body` — primary content
- `type.ui.label` — UI labels
- `type.ui.caption` — metadata and secondary information

## Font weights

Only two font weights are used:
- Regular (400)
- Medium (500)

This constraint helps maintain visual consistency and reduces noise.
